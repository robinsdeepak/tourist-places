## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of the same application concept—a tourist places viewer—using different technologies to demonstrate their unique features, strengths, and complexities.

Each version of the app allows users to:

- View information about tourist places, including images, best time to visit, and best things to do.
- Navigate between different tourist places.
- _(Enhanced versions)_ Mark places as favorites and view a list of favorite places.
